This is a copy of the original MIT App Inventor Web component, but with the URL splitted in multiple parts. I noticed that many RESTful API have similar URL schemes. The final URL consists of 

`ServiceURL`+`APIVersion`+`APIVersion`+`RequestData`+`FormatType`

Don't forget the slashes between the fields!

Current version number is 2
