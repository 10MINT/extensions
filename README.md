# extensions

A repository with my App Inventor extensions and its logos.

For development and preview extensions, take a look at the beta branch. Those extensions may not work properly and are not representative.
DO NOT USE THEM IN PRODUCTION VERSIONS, THEY CAN DESTROY YOUR PROJECT. Extensions that are no longer supported can now be found in the 
deprecated branch

## Each folder (hopefully) includes

* the extension file
* the extension's image
* description
* demo file
